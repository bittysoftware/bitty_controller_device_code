# bitty_controller_code - microbit C++ code

## Description

Example C/C++ implementations of microbit code for use with various types of hardware including a Kitronik buggy, a BitBot buggy and for switching on/off devices (e.g. LEDs) connected to the microbit edge connector.

## Building this code

To build this code, you need an offline microbit development environment, based on Yotta. See https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/offline-toolchains/ for details.
